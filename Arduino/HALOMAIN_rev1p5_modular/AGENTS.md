> September17 user test: **both boards completed the physical185→186 manual OTA and run app0 / SDK VALID**. Exact hashes passed; native policy resolved, Home returned and both boards slept. **OTA presentation failed:** the user saw a frozen Checking for updates screen during LCD transfer because the flash-safety guard suppresses rendering. This remains unfixed; do not call186 full UI acceptance. The final02:00 Pacific schedule is verified unchanged. See `docs/MANUAL_OTA_186_20260917.md` and the current release record.

# HALO Firmware Agent Guide

Current code starting point is `62c6864b4c154ed6dc2cb2bc331f2afbd9f02bb2` (186), firmware tree `153c3cc3f87df60ad9490d23e03e7deb198f519c`. Only the three generated version headers differ from sealed 185. The complete185 working-source/acceptance record is retained under `previous_working_source_185`, alongside the unchanged183 and frozen158 history. The sealed 186 pair is `55fc4c636091`; publication is verified, not device acceptance.

The installed unit is **Sense186 app0 / LCD186 app0**, both SDK VALID after the user physically initiated the paired OTA. A declared one-test allowance was used; passive capture closed with zero injected commands. Transport, boot and sleep passed, while the frozen transfer UI remains a confirmed issue. Daily **02:00 Pacific** remains unchanged. Read `docs/MANUAL_OTA_186_20260917.md` for the186 publication and pending user test; the185 cause/evidence document is unchanged.

The following178/179 notes are historical qualification limits.178 fixes the observed camera-cancelled Wi-Fi association delay and enables narrowly proved, charged recovery of closed OTA discovery. Its rapid camera/voice checks and two saved image/voice deliveries passed within recorded limits; cloud custody was independently confirmed and retry wakes stayed dark. 179 retains early manual intent and waits for transient list/HTTP ownership inside the original deadline. Two real 179 manual requests fetched both older public 162 manifests and completed checked-pair bookkeeping. Cross-board logs support cleanup; strict test controllers stopped on truncated USB diagnostic lines, and their failures remain recorded. The first check's paired sleep is directly captured. A final ordinary wake confirmed normal unlocked Home, persisted the next 02:00 Pacific LCD arm, and returned both boards to sleep.

At that earlier178/179 checkpoint, public manifests remained162. The older-manifest `downgrade_blocked` result still maps to generic failure wording; this does not qualify equal-version UpToDate UI or an OTA transfer. Early-startup preservation is host-tested; no dedicated physical early-window assertion passed. Preserve provisioning, memory-reserve, USB-connected and full-product qualification limits. The old179 timed installation harness can tap an awake foreground screen and must not be reused.180 used a separate Home identity gate and one initial actuator stroke only when LCD USB was absent. Retain exact private artifacts and receipts; no public release is claimed.

## Release Baseline

- Start future OTA work from `RELEASE_BASELINE.json.current_working_source`, retaining162 camera input recovery,159 wake handling and the158 fixes. `current_baseline` and tag `halo-v6.4.158` identify the immutable recovery/previous scheduled qualification. Read `docs/FROZEN_RELEASE_158.md`, `docs/LCD_USER_WAKE_159.md` and `docs/BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md`. Historical117 qualification does not select the current source.
- Run `python3 -B tools/verify_frozen_baseline.py` before preparing new firmware. Preserve the immutable 158 tag and binaries; new changes need an unused version at least 6.4.187 after a fresh inventory check. The guard verifies committed ancestry and retained bytes, not uncommitted edits or device acceptance.
- Use `docs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.md` for finite shipping acceptance. Preserve the distinction between bench evidence, shipping build evidence and actual production acceptance.
- Prepare release metadata from clean committed source with `tools/prepare_production_release.py`, then use the external snapshot's `tools/build_ota_policy_production.py`. Follow `docs/OTA_POLICY_PRODUCTION_BUILD.md`; do not publish repository precommit metadata or substitute a flag-free Arduino build. `publish_both.sh` consumes prebuilt artifacts only.
- Keep `RELEASE_BASELINE.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` synchronized with actual source, artifact, acceptance and publication receipts. Never fill release commit/tag or success fields prospectively.

## Production Targets

- Sense production entry: `halo_ota_demo/firmware/halo_sense_prod/halo_sense_prod.ino`
- LCD production entry: `halo_ota_demo/firmware/halo_lcd_prod/halo_lcd_prod.ino`
- Core device logic still lives in:
  - `Sense_Minimal/Sense_Minimal.ino`
  - `LCD_Minimal/LCD_Minimal.ino`
- Shared production modules live in `halo_ota_demo/firmware/shared/`

## Board Roles

- Sense: Wi-Fi, provisioning, MQTT, OTA orchestration, camera, audio, sleep coordination.
- LCD: LVGL UI, touch/knob input, local sleep handling, LCD OTA client.
- Cross-board link: UART1 at 115200 baud plus GPIO wake signaling.
- Production UART behavior is newline-delimited JSON, not the legacy framed protocol described in `firmware/shared/UartProto.h`.

## Production Folders

- Treat these as source of truth for current production work:
  - `halo_ota_demo/`
  - `Sense_Minimal/`
  - `LCD_Minimal/`
  - `halo_common/`
  - `halomain_assets/`
- Treat demo/reference folders as non-production unless a task explicitly says otherwise.

## Safe Edit Rules

- Change one subsystem at a time.
- Preserve current behavior unless the task explicitly requires a fix.
- Do not casually change pins, baud rates, wake timing, sleep sequencing, OTA URLs, or message names.
- Prefer small extractions behind existing interfaces over rewrites.
- Keep wrapper sketches thin, but do not do big-bang migrations.
- Avoid repo-wide formatting or unrelated cleanup during firmware refactors.

## Module Boundaries

- `firmware/shared/`: shared Wi-Fi, OTA, provisioning, build info, and coordination helpers.
- `Sense_Minimal/`: Sense runtime, camera/audio flows, sleep path, UART receive handling.
- `LCD_Minimal/`: LCD runtime, LVGL/UI flow, UART receive dispatch, sleep/wake behavior.
- `halo_common/`: board identity and cross-board protocol/pin headers.

## Do Not Touch Casually

- Sense sleep entry and wake-source logic.
- LCD LVGL lock ownership between `loop()` and `ui_task`.
- UART JSON schema and coordination messages.
- OTA host allowlist and manifest path logic.
- Camera power, deinit, and hold behavior.

## Validation

- Build the production OTA implementation with the canonical entry, which supplies and records the durable policy/diagnostic flags and verifies actual FQBN/partition/UI settings:
  - `python3 tools/build_ota_policy_production.py --out /absolute/path/to/new-build`
  - Add `--board sense` or `--board lcd` for one target; `--plan` prints the commands without compiling.
- See `docs/OTA_POLICY_PRODUCTION_BUILD.md` for feature defaults and compatibility-build limitations.
- Run focused hardware checks for the subsystem you touched.
- Minimum post-change smoke check:
  - both boards cold boot
  - UART handshake succeeds
  - one user-visible action on the affected board still works
  - sleep/wake still works if the change touched power, UART, OTA, or maintenance logic

## Refactor Approach

- First extract pure helpers and duplicated constants.
- Next isolate protocol helpers and state-machine logic.
- Leave hardware-heavy paths for later, smaller passes with explicit hardware validation.
