# HALO Firmware Agent Guide

- Current installed development baseline is private167 (Sense app1, LCD app0, SDK VALID). A minimal168 candidate removes the optional final Wi-Fi diagnostic UART frame; read `docs/SLEEP_TAIL_168.md` and `docs/OFFLINE_MEDIA_STRESS_167.md`. Disk space is available; new build/device validation is pending. Preserve the tested167 pair, known incomplete image residue, and historical165/166 evidence. Public OTA is last-verified162; no168 installation or publication yet. Durable image backend remains test-owner only.

## Release Baseline

- Start future OTA work from `RELEASE_BASELINE.json.current_working_source`, retaining162 camera input recovery,159 wake handling and the158 fixes. `current_baseline` and tag `halo-v6.4.158` identify the immutable recovery/previous scheduled qualification. Read `docs/FROZEN_RELEASE_158.md`, `docs/LCD_USER_WAKE_159.md` and `docs/BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md`. Historical117 qualification does not select the current source.
- Run `python3 -B tools/verify_frozen_baseline.py` before preparing new firmware. Preserve the immutable 158 tag and binaries; new changes need an unused version at least 6.4.168. The guard verifies committed ancestry and retained bytes, not uncommitted edits or device acceptance.
- Use `docs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.md` for finite shipping acceptance. Preserve the distinction between bench evidence, shipping build evidence and actual production acceptance.
- Prepare release metadata from clean committed source with `tools/prepare_production_release.py`, then use the external snapshot's `tools/build_ota_policy_production.py`. Follow `docs/OTA_POLICY_PRODUCTION_BUILD.md`; do not publish repository precommit metadata or substitute a flag-free Arduino build. `publish_both.sh` consumes prebuilt artifacts only.
- Keep `RELEASE_BASELINE.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` synchronized with actual source, artifact, acceptance and publication receipts. Never fill release commit/tag or success fields prospectively.

## Production Targets

- Sense production entry: `halo_ota_demo/firmware/halo_sense_prod/halo_sense_prod.ino`
- LCD production entry: `halo_ota_demo/firmware/halo_lcd_prod/halo_lcd_prod.ino`
- Core device logic still lives in:
  - `Sense_Minimal/Sense_Minimal.ino`
  - `LCD_Minimal/LCD_Minimal.ino`
- Shared production modules live in `halo_ota_demo/firmware/shared/`

## Board Roles

- Sense: Wi-Fi, provisioning, MQTT, OTA orchestration, camera, audio, sleep coordination.
- LCD: LVGL UI, touch/knob input, local sleep handling, LCD OTA client.
- Cross-board link: UART1 at 115200 baud plus GPIO wake signaling.
- Production UART behavior is newline-delimited JSON, not the legacy framed protocol described in `firmware/shared/UartProto.h`.

## Production Folders

- Treat these as source of truth for current production work:
  - `halo_ota_demo/`
  - `Sense_Minimal/`
  - `LCD_Minimal/`
  - `halo_common/`
  - `halomain_assets/`
- Treat demo/reference folders as non-production unless a task explicitly says otherwise.

## Safe Edit Rules

- Change one subsystem at a time.
- Preserve current behavior unless the task explicitly requires a fix.
- Do not casually change pins, baud rates, wake timing, sleep sequencing, OTA URLs, or message names.
- Prefer small extractions behind existing interfaces over rewrites.
- Keep wrapper sketches thin, but do not do big-bang migrations.
- Avoid repo-wide formatting or unrelated cleanup during firmware refactors.

## Module Boundaries

- `firmware/shared/`: shared Wi-Fi, OTA, provisioning, build info, and coordination helpers.
- `Sense_Minimal/`: Sense runtime, camera/audio flows, sleep path, UART receive handling.
- `LCD_Minimal/`: LCD runtime, LVGL/UI flow, UART receive dispatch, sleep/wake behavior.
- `halo_common/`: board identity and cross-board protocol/pin headers.

## Do Not Touch Casually

- Sense sleep entry and wake-source logic.
- LCD LVGL lock ownership between `loop()` and `ui_task`.
- UART JSON schema and coordination messages.
- OTA host allowlist and manifest path logic.
- Camera power, deinit, and hold behavior.

## Validation

- Build the production OTA implementation with the canonical entry, which supplies and records the durable policy/diagnostic flags and verifies actual FQBN/partition/UI settings:
  - `python3 tools/build_ota_policy_production.py --out /absolute/path/to/new-build`
  - Add `--board sense` or `--board lcd` for one target; `--plan` prints the commands without compiling.
- See `docs/OTA_POLICY_PRODUCTION_BUILD.md` for feature defaults and compatibility-build limitations.
- Run focused hardware checks for the subsystem you touched.
- Minimum post-change smoke check:
  - both boards cold boot
  - UART handshake succeeds
  - one user-visible action on the affected board still works
  - sleep/wake still works if the change touched power, UART, OTA, or maintenance logic

## Refactor Approach

- First extract pure helpers and duplicated constants.
- Next isolate protocol helpers and state-machine logic.
- Leave hardware-heavy paths for later, smaller passes with explicit hardware validation.
